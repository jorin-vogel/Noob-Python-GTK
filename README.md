Inside this repo you can find two little projects:

* with Texttransformer you can transform text-string in two funny ways
* and Vokabeltrainer provides really basic functionality to learn a language
  (in this case German -> English)

- UI with Glade (GTK)
- Programming with Python 2.6

--

There is nothing special about this projects.
The only reason you can find them here is that I want to be able to look back in the future and laugh about the way I were programming back then.

The code inside here is only useful for you, if  you search for something to laugh about or an example how not to do it.

## But anyway, enjoy it!
