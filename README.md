These projects are just personal memories about the first programs I have written - at least of the ones that I can still find nowadays.

Please don't use this code as a reference; unless you search for examples of how not to do things.

---------------------------------

Inside this repo you can find two little projects:

* With Texttransformer you can transform strings in two fun ways
* Vokabeltrainer provides really basic functionality to study vocabulary
  (in this case German -> English)

I used simple technologies and looking back I think that I made a good choice for a starter:

- UI with Glade (GTK)
- Programming with Python 2.6
