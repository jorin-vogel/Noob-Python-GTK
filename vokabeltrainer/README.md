It is worth to notice at this point that the `trainer_base.py` can be used with the command-line to access the same data and the same functionality the GUI version offers.

My favorite parts:

- 4 different files to store some data
- the excessive use of the evil exec function
- using numbers to distinguish the different cases
- the endless mess of if and elif statements
